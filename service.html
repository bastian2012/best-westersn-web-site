                    The clever folks at <a href="">leaveyourluggage.com </a> have created a service that is so simple and sensible it is amazing nobody 
                    thought of it before. Rather than spending the last day in Haiti dragging suitcases around, visitors can sign up online 
                    and have their bags delivered to the airport ready for collection. It is the perfect service for those who don’t want to 
                    waste any of their precious time in the city.  We took shuttle bus from airport to Termini and drop off point was at the end of Via Magenta. Verey easy to find hotel. Cheaper than taxi.
